# EWW Sideboard fork
This is the fork of saimoomedits's sideboard I use in my [linux config](https://github.com/fabischw/fedora-dotfiles)

This fork is meant for archiving the [original config](https://github.com/fabischw/eww-sideboard-fork/tree/cfb2523a4e37ed2979e964998d9a4c37232b2975) and documenting my changes

Please keep in mind that this config does NOT work on it's own as it requires external scripts to function, more information can be found in my [linux config repo](https://github.com/fabischw/fedora-dotfiles)
